* Bob sends an encrypted message to Alice, and also sends his digital certificate to Alice to prove his identity. How does Alice prove that it is Bob who sent the message?
* The core trust on the Internet is based around PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). Outline how digital certificates are used to provide a degree of trustworthiness.
* Bob has just produced a key pair, in a Base-64 format, and now wants to send this to Alice. What advice would you give him on sending the key pair to Alice? **Where would I find this info?** Have a think about the certificate which is distributed. You can observe it here.

Learning Outlines:

* Able to explain the handshaking involved in setting up an SSL/TLS tunnel, especially on how the key exchange and encryption methods are defined.
* Able to examine a network trace file (PCAP) for the handshaking involved an identify the key elements of the tunnel.
* Able to understand the scope of the tunnel, and where encryption is applied.

You should be able to analyse each of the following for the key elements of creating a secure tunnel:

* How does Ethereum overcome the problems of the proof-of-work method? [Ref: Blockchain]
* How does the payment of gas focus developers to create efficient coding? [Ref: Blockchain]
* Alice says that her Bitcoin ID address uses Base-64. Is this the case? If not, what format does it use? [Ref: Blockchain]
* Trent says that no way that anyone can track his transactions on Bitcoin. Is this true? If not, explain your argument. [Ref: Bitcoin]
* What evidence does a miner have to give to show it has found the required hash for a block? [Ref: Blockchain]
* How many bits does a Bitcoin ID have? Outline the process of generating the ID. [Ref: Bitcoin]
* With Ethereum, with the genesis block, what are the difficulty, the gaslimit and alloc used for? [Ref: Ethereum]
* Alice tells you that Ethereum uses JavaScript to create a smart contract. You are worried that JavaScript doesn't seem to be a trustworthy language. What is required to make the code running on the blockchain trustworthy? [Ref: Ethereum]
* Bob generates his private key and views it. Can you explain to him what the following listing defines:

Learning Outlines:

* Define the key attributes used to assess the quality of a light-weight encryption method.
* Idenity the operation of a simple Zero-knowledge Proof method.
* Understand how the Pedersen Commitment could be used in hidding the values of a transaction.

* Understand how Docker could be used to setup a secure service (such as for SSH).

Sample questions:

* Define the basic security controls using within JWT.
* Bob the Developer says that JWT is the right way to create a Single Sign On (SSO) for the corportate infrastructure. Is this a good approach? Discuss possible strengths and weaknesses.
* Bob says that OAuth 2.0 is an excellent way to provide authentication into a corporate infrastructure. Is he correct? Justify your answer.
