# Unit 9: Future Crypto Lab

Aim:		To provide a foundation in some of the up-and-coming methods in cryptography.

## Light-weight crypto
### L1	
In many operations within public key methods we use the exponential operation:

g<sup>x</sup> (mod p)

If we compute the value of gx and then perform a (mod p) it is a very costly operation in terms of CPU as the value of gx will be large. A more efficient method it use Montgomery reduction and use pow(g,x,p). 

```Python
import random
g=3
x= random.randint(2, 100)
n=997
res1 = g**x % n
res2= pow(g,x, n)
print res1
print res2
```

Repl.it: https://repl.it/@billbuchanan/powex

Now add some code to determine the time taken to perform each of the two operations, and compare them:

Can you now put each of the methods into a loop, and perform each calculation 1,000 times?

Now measure the times taken. What do you observe?


Now increase the range for x (so that it is relatively large) and make n a large prime number. What do you observe from the performance:


### L2	
Normally light-weight crypto has to be fast and efficient. The XTEA method is one of the fastest around. Some standard open source code in Node.js is (use npm install xtea):

```Node.js
var xtea = require('xtea');

var plaintext = new Buffer('ABCDEFGH', 'utf8');
var key = new Buffer('0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF', 'hex');
var ciphertext = xtea.encrypt( plaintext, key );

console.log('Cipher:\t'+ ciphertext.toString('hex') );
console.log('Decipher:\t'+ xtea.decrypt( ciphertext, key ).toString() );
```

Repl.it: https://repl.it/@billbuchanan/xteajs

A sample run is:
<pre>
Cipher:	52deb267335dd52a49837931c233cea8
Decipher:	ABCDEFGH
</pre>



What is the block and key size of XTEA?



Can you add some code to measure the time taken for 1,000 encryptions?


Can you estimate the number for encryption keys that could be tried per second on your system?


If possible, run the code on another machine, and estimate the rate of encryption keys that can be used per second:



### L3	
RC4 is a stream cipher created by Ron Rivest and has a variable key length.  Run the following Python code and test it:

```Python
def KSA(key):
    keylength = len(key)

    S = range(256)

    j = 0
    for i in range(256):
        j = (j + S[i] + key[i % keylength]) % 256
        S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]  # swap

    return S


def PRGA(S):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while True:
        i = (i + 1) % 256
        j = (j + S[i]) % 256
        S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]  # swap

        K = S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]
        yield K

def RC4(key):
    S = KSA(key)
    return PRGA(S)

def asctohex(string_in):
	a=""
	for x in string_in:
		a = a + ("0"+((hex(ord(x)))[2:]))[-2:]
	return(a)

def convert_key(s):
        return [ord(c) for c in s]

key="0102030405"

plaintext = 'Hello'

if (len(sys.argv)>1):
	plaintext=str(sys.argv[1])

if (len(sys.argv)>2):
	key=str(sys.argv[2])

key = key.decode('hex')
key = convert_key(key)

keystream = RC4(key)
print "Keystream: ",
for i in range (0,15):
	print hex(keystream.next()),
print
print "Cipher: ",
keystream = RC4(key)

for c in plaintext:
	sys.stdout.write("%02X" % (ord(c) ^ keystream.next()))
```

Now go to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6229 and test a few key generation values and see if you get the same key stream.

Tests:

Key: 0102030405 Key stream (first six bytes):

Key:		Key stream (first six bytes):

Key:		Key stream (first six bytes):

Key:		Key stream (first six bytes):

How does the Python code produce a key stream length which matches the input data stream:


Can you test the code by decrypting the cipher stream (note: you just use the same code, and do the same operation again)?


RC4 uses an s-Box. Can you find a way to print out the S-box values for a key of “0102030405”?


What are the main advantages of having a variable key size and having a stream cipher in light-weight cryptography?



### L4	
The ELLI method can be used to identify an RFID tag.

 

Can you run the following code and determine that it works (C and D should be the same)? Can you also explain how it works?



```Python
from os import urandom
from eccsnacks.curve25519 import scalarmult, scalarmult_base
import binascii

lamb = urandom(32)
a = scalarmult_base(lamb)

eps = urandom(32)
b = scalarmult_base(eps)

c = scalarmult(eps, a)

d = scalarmult(lamb, b)

print "RFID private key: ",binascii.hexlify(eps)

print "Reader private key: ",binascii.hexlify(lamb)

print 
print "A value: ",binascii.hexlify(a)
print "B value: ",binascii.hexlify(b)

print "C value: ",binascii.hexlify(c)
print "D value: ",binascii.hexlify(d)
```

## 3	Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)

### L5	
With ZKP, Alice can prove that he still knows something to Bob, without revealing her secret. At the basis of many methods is the Fiat-Shamir method:

 
Ref: https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/fiat


The following code implements some basic code for Fiat-Shamir, can you prove that for a number of values of x, that Alice will always be able to prove that she knows x.

x:       Proved: Y/N
x:       Proved: Y/N
x:       Proved: Y/N
x:       Proved: Y/N

The value of n is a prime number. Now increase the value of n, and determine the effect that this has on the time taken to compute the proof:



```Python
import sys
import random

n=97

g= 5

x = random.randint(1,5)
v = random.randint(n//2,n)
c = random.randint(1,5)

y= pow(g,x, n)

t = pow(g,v,n)

r = (v - c * x)

print r
if (r<0): r=-r

Result = ( pow(g,r,n)) * (pow(y,c,n))  % n


print 'x=',x
print 'c=',c
print 'v=',v
print 'P=',n
print 'G=',g
print '======'
print 't=',t
print 'r=',Result
if (t==Result):
	print 'Alice has proven she knows x'
else:
	print 'Alice has not proven she knows x'
```

### L6	
We can now expand this method by creating a password, and then making this the secret. Copy and run the code here:

https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/fiat2

Now test the code with different passwords?


How does the password get converting into a form which can be used in the Fiat-Shamir method?



### L1.7	
The Diffie-Hellman method can be used to perform a zero-knowledge proof implementation. Copy the code from the following link and verify that it works:
