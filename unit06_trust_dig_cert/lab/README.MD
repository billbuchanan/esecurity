# Lab 6: Trust and Digital Certificates

Objective: Digital certificates are used to define a trust infrastructure within PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). A certificate can hold a key pair, while a distributable certificate will only contain the public key. In this lab we will read-in digital certificates and analyse them.


## A	Introduction
No	Description	Result
### A.1	From:

Web link (Digital Certificate): http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/digitalcert

Open up Certificate 1 and identify the following:	Serial number:

Effective date:

Name:

Issuer:

What is CN used for:

What is ON used for:

What is O used for:

What is L used for:



### A.2	Now open-up the ZIP file for the certificate, and view the CER file.

What other information can you gain from the certificate:

What is the size of the public key:

Which hashing method has been used:

Is the certificate trusted on your system: [Yes][No]

### A.3	Make a connection to the www.live.com Web site:
<pre>
openssl s_client -connect www.live.com:443
</pre>

Can you identity the certificate chain?

What is the subject on the certificate?

Who is the issuer on the certificate?

### A.4	

Google moved in July 2018 to mark sites as being insecure if they did not have a match between their digital certificate and the site. A scan, at the time, on health and social care sites from the following page showed problems in digital certificates:
<pre>
https://bit.ly/2EkUvX0
</pre>

Outline three sites that still have problems with their digital certificate, and the reason for the problem (you perhaps should try Chrome to assess):







Pick two sites that you feel are not setup properly for their digital certificate, and then run a scan from SSLLabs (www.ssllabs.com). Identify the problems that they have with their digital certificate:





What are their SSLLabs rating?



Can you find a site with an “T” rating?

 





### A.5	Which the certificates in A.2, for Example 2 to Example 6. Complete the following table:

Cert	Organisation (Issued to)	Date range when valid	Size of public key	Issuer	Root CA	Hash method	Is it trusted?
2	

						
3	

						
4	

						
5	

						
6	

						

### A.6	Now download the DER files from:

Web link (Digital Certificate): http://asecuritysite.com/der.zip

Now use openssl to read the certificates:
<pre>
openssl x509 -inform der -in [certname] -noout -text
</pre>
## B	Creating certificates

Now we will create our own self-signed certificates.


No	Description	Result

### B.1	Create your own certificate from:

Web link (Create Certificate): http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/createcert

Add in your own details.	View the certificate, and verify some of the details on the certificate.


Can you view the DER file?



We have a root certificate authority of My Global Corp, which is based in Washington, US, and the administrator is admin@myglobalcorp.com and we are going to issue a certificate to My Little Corp, which is based in Glasgow, UK, and the administrator is admin@mylittlecorp.com.


### B.2	Create your RSA key pair with:
<pre>
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
</pre>

Next create a self-signed root CA certificate ca.crt for My Global Corp:
<pre>
openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
</pre>


	
How many years will the certificate be valid for?


Which details have you entered:





### B.3	
Next go to Places, and from your Home folder, open up ca.crt and view the details of the certificate.

Which Key Algorithm has been used:

Which hashing methods have been used:

When does the certificate expire:

Who is it verified by:

Who has it been issued to:


### B.4	
Next we will create a subordinate CA (My Little Corp), and which will be used for the signing of the certificate. First, generate the key:
<pre>
openssl genrsa -out ia.key 2048
</pre>

Next we will request a certificate for our newly created subordinate CA:
<pre>
openssl req -new -key ia.key -out ia.csr
</pre>

We can then create a certificate from the subordinate CA certificate and signed by the root CA.
<pre>
openssl x509 -req -days 730 -in ia.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out ia.crt
</pre>
View the newly created certificate.

When does it expire:
	
Who is the subject of the certificate:

Which is their country:

Who signed the certificate:

Which is their country:

What is the serial number of the certificate:

Check the serial number for the root certificate. What is its serial number:

### B.5	
If we want to use this certificate to digitally sign files and verify the signatures, we need to convert it to a PKCS12 file:
<pre>
openssl pkcs12 -export -out ia.p12 -inkey ia.key -in ia.crt -chain -CAfile ca.crt
</pre>

Can you view ia.p12 in a text edit?



### B.6	
The crt format is in encoded in binary. If we want to export to a Base64 format, we can use DER:
<pre>
openssl x509 -inform pem -outform pem -in ca.crt -out ca.cer
</pre>
and for My Little Corp:
<pre>
openssl x509 -inform pem -outform pem -in ia.crt -out ia.cer
</pre>
View each of the output files in a text editor (ca.cer and then ia.cer). What can you observe from the format:



Which are the standard headers and footers used:



### B.7	Enter and run the following program, and verify its operation:

```python
import OpenSSL.crypto
from OpenSSL.crypto import load_certificate_request, FILETYPE_PEM

csr = '''-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

What are the details on the requests?






## C	Elliptic Curve Key Creation
Elliptic curve key pairs are increasing used within corporate Web sites. 

In Openssl we can view the curves with the ecparam option:
<pre>
openssl ecparam -list_curves
</pre>

Outline some of the curve names:




By performing an Internet search, which are the most popular curves (and where are they used)?




We can create our elliptic parameter file with:
<pre>
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -out secp256k1.pem
</pre>
Now view the details with:
<pre>
openssl ecparam -in secp256k1.pem -text -param_enc explicit -noout
</pre>
What are the details of the key?



Now we can create our key pair:
<pre>
openssl ecparam -in secp256k1.pem -genkey -noout -out mykey.pem
</pre>

Now we will encrypt your key pair (and add a password), and convert it into a format which is ready to be converted into a digital certificate:
<pre>
openssl ec -aes-128-cbc -in mykey.pem -out enckey.pem
</pre>

Finally we will convert into a DER format, so that we can import the keys into a system:
<pre>
openssl ec -in enckey.pem -outform DER -out enckey.der
</pre>

Examine each of the files created and outline what they contain:




Now pick another elliptic curve type and perform the same operations as above. Which type did you use?



Outline the commands used:






If you want to create a non-encrypted version (PFX), which command would you use:





Go to www.cloudflare.com and examine the digital certificate on the site.

What is the public key method used?


What is the size of the public key?


What is the curve type used?

## E	PFX files
We have a root certificate authority of My Global Corp, which is based in Washington, US, and the administrator is admin@myglobalcorp.com and we are going to issue a certificate to My Little Corp, which is based in Glasgow, UK, and the administrator is admin@mylittlecorp.com.


### E.1	We will now view some PFX certificate files, and which are protected with a password:

Web link (Digital Certificates): http://asecuritysite.com/encryption/digitalcert2

For Certificate 1, can you open it in the Web browser with an incorrect password:


Now enter “apples” as a password, and record some of the key details of the certificate:


Now repeat for Certificate 2:



### E.2	
Now with the PFX files (contained in the ZIP files from the Web site), try and import them onto your computer. Try to enter an incorrect password first and observe the message.


Was the import successful?


If successful, outline some of the details of the certificates:




## F	Cracking Certificates
Digital certificates are often protected with a simple password. With this we can use a Python program to try various passwords on the certificate, and if it does not create an exception, then we have found the required password. First download the following pfx files:

https://asecuritysite.com/cert_crack.zip

Now for fred.pfx, crack the password with the following code:

```python
import OpenSSL 
from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

str="fred.pfx"
passwords=["ankle","battery","password","bill","apple","apples","orange"]

for password in passwords:
	try:
		pfx = open(str, 'rb').read()
		
		p12 = OpenSSL.crypto.load_pkcs12(pfx, password)
		print "Found: ",password


		privkey=OpenSSL.crypto.dump_privatekey(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, p12.get_privatekey())

		cert=OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, p12.get_certificate())

		cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert, default_backend())


		print " Issuer: ",cert.issuer
		print " Subect: ",cert.subject
		print " Serial number: ",cert.serial_number
		print " Hash: ",cert.signature_hash_algorithm.name
		print privkey
		print certificate


	except:

		print "Not working: ",password
```

What is the password?


The files bill01.pfx, bill02.pfx … bill18.pfx have a password which are fruits. Can you determine the fruits used:


The files country01.pfx, country02.pfx … country06.pfx have a password which are countries. Can you determine the countries used:



## G	Setting up a certificate on a Web site
### G.1	
Now we will enable HTTPs on an Apache Web Server, and install a digital certificate. Execute the following commands:
<pre>
sudo a2enmod ssl
service apache2 restart
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
sudo openssl req -nodes -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
sudo cp ca.crt ca.key ca.csr /etc/apache2/ssl/
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>

HTTPs should now be enabled with a self-signed certificate. If you try https://localhost, you will have to add an exception to view the page, as we are using a self-signed certificate:

 

## What I should have learnt from this lab?
The key things learnt:

* Understand how digital certificates are generated and ported onto systems.
* Identifying problems with digital certificates on sites.
* Understand how Python could be used in the analysis of certificates.
