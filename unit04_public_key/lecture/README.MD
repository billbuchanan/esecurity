# e-Security Unit 4: Public Key

The key concepts are: Basics, RSA, Elliptic Curve and ElGamal.

## What you should know at the end of unit?

* Explain how public key provides both privacy and identity verification.
  * Where would I find this info? This unit explains public key.
* Understand how the RSA process works, with a simple example.
* Understand how elliptic curve cryptography works, with a simple example.
* Explain the operation of PGP.
* Understands how the private key is used to check the identity of the sender, and how public key is used to preserve the privacy of the message.
* Explain how the e and d values are determined within the RSA method.
  * Where would I find this info? There are some examples [here](https://asecuritysite.com/log/rsa_examples.pdf).
