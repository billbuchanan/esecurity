# 3. Hashing and MAC

The key concepts are: MD2. MD4. MD5. SHA-1. Salting. Collisions. Murmur and FNV. Bloom Filter. LM Hash. SHA-3. Bcrypt. PBKDF2. Open SSL Hash passwords. One Time Passwords. Timed One Time Password (TOTP). Hashed One Time Password (HOTP). HMAC.

## What you should know at the end of unit?

* How the lengths of the hashes vary with the number of bits in the hash.
* How we can calculate the strengths on passwords.
* Understand how salt is applied to the hashing process.
* Define how collisions can occur within hashing.
* Implement hash cracking methods (John the Ripper and Hashcat).
* Defines the usage of signed hashes (eg HMAC).
* Outlines the usage of OTP and Timed Passwords.
